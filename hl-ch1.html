  <h2>Expected Utility and Individual Decisions</h2>
  <p>
    This chapter introduces the central theme of the book: how individuals make consumption and investment decisions under uncertainty, and how these decisions influence the valuation of financial assets.
  </p>
  <p>
    A widely accepted framework for modeling asset choice under uncertainty is the <strong>expected utility hypothesis</strong>. Under this hypothesis, each individual:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Forms subjective probabilities of future asset payoffs</li>
    <li>Assigns a utility value to each possible consumption outcome</li>
    <li>Chooses a consumption-investment policy to maximize expected utility</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Mathematically, preferences are represented by a utility function \( u(\cdot) \), and a random consumption outcome \( x \) is preferred to another outcome \( y \) if and only if:
  </p>
  <p>
    \[
      \mathbb{E}[u(x)] \geq \mathbb{E}[u(y)]
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    where the expectation \( \mathbb{E} \) is taken with respect to the individual's subjective probability distribution over outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2>Consumption Plans and Expected Utility Representation</h2>
  <p>
    Consider a two-period model: time 0 (decision point) and time 1 (consumption). Uncertainty is captured through a finite set of states of nature, denoted by \( \Omega \), with \( \omega \in \Omega \) representing an individual state.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <strong>consumption plan</strong> \( z \) specifies the number of units of a single good available in each state at time 1. This plan can be viewed as a vector or a random variable, with \( z(\omega) \) representing consumption in state \( \omega \).
  </p>
  <p>
    Preferences over such plans are represented by a <em>preference relation</em> that allows the comparison of different consumption vectors. If preferences can be captured by a utility function \( H \), then:
  </p>
  <p>
    \[
      z \succeq z' \iff H(z) \geq H(z')
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    To simplify analysis in high-dimensional state spaces, we use an <strong>expected utility representation</strong>:
  </p>
  <p>
    \[
      z \succeq z' \iff \mathbb{E}[u(z)] \geq \mathbb{E}[u(z')]
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    where \( u \) is defined on deterministic (sure) outcomes and extended to random plans via integration under a probability measure \( P \). For certain plans \( z = x \), \( u(z) = u(x) \).
  </p>
  <p>
    This framework leads to the <strong>von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function</strong>, developed under objective probability assumptions, and extended by Savage under subjective beliefs. In this book, the distinction is not emphasized—both are treated as defining \( u \) over certain outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2>Preference Relations: Definitions and Properties</h2>
  <p>
    Let \( X \) denote the set of all possible consumption plans. A <strong>binary relation</strong> on \( X \) is a collection of ordered pairs \( (z, y) \) where plan \( z \) is compared to plan \( y \). If \( z \) is preferred to \( y \), we write \( z \succeq y \); otherwise, we write \( z \not\succeq y \).
  </p>
  <p>
    A binary relation is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transitive</strong> if \( z \succeq y \) and \( y \succeq v \) implies \( z \succeq v \).</li>
    <li><strong>Complete</strong> if for any \( z, y \in X \), either \( z \succeq y \), \( y \succeq z \), or both.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A <strong>preference relation</strong> is a binary relation that is both transitive and complete.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on a preference relation \( \succeq \), we can define:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Indifference</strong>: \( z \sim y \) if \( z \succeq y \) and \( y \succeq z \)</li>
    <li><strong>Strict preference</strong>: \( z \succ y \) if \( z \succeq y \) but not \( y \succeq z \)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These derived relations help classify how individuals compare consumption plans under uncertainty.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Utility Representation for Finite Preferences</h2>
  <p>
    When the set \( X \) of consumption plans is finite, any preference relation \( \succeq \) can be represented by a utility function \( U \), such that
    \[
    z_n \succeq z_m \quad \text{if and only if} \quad U(z_n) \geq U(z_m).
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    The construction of such a utility function is illustrated through an example. Let \( z_1, z_2, z_3 \in X \). Start by assigning a base value to one plan, say:
    \[
    H(z_3) = b.
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    Then compare \( z_2 \) and \( z_1 \) with \( z_3 \), and define \( H(z_2) \) and \( H(z_1) \) accordingly:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If \( z_2 \succ z_3 \), assign \( H(z_2) = b + 1 \)</li>
    <li>If \( z_2 \sim z_3 \), assign \( H(z_2) = b \)</li>
    <li>If \( z_2 \prec z_3 \), assign \( H(z_2) = b - 1 \)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Similarly, assign values to \( H(z_1) \) based on its comparison with the others. This procedure ensures that:
    \[
    H(z_n) \geq H(z_m) \quad \text{if and only if} \quad z_n \succeq z_m.
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    The example shows how a numerical index can capture preference rankings. This construction can be extended to any countable set \( X \), ensuring utility representation for complete and transitive preferences.
  </p>

  <h2>Expected Utility Representation</h2>
  <p>
    For an uncountably infinite set of consumption plans, preference relations are more nuanced. Some, such as the <em>lexicographic preference relation</em>, cannot be represented by any utility function.
  </p>
  <p>
    To represent preferences under uncertainty, we use the <strong>expected utility framework</strong>. Let \( \Omega \) denote the state space with probability \( P \), which can be either objective or subjective. A <em>consumption plan</em> \( z \) is modeled as a random variable defined on \( \Omega \).
  </p>
  <p>
    The distribution function \( F \) of a consumption plan \( z \) is:
    \[
    F(x) = P(\omega \in \Omega : z(\omega) \leq x).
    \]
    Given a utility function \( u \), the expected utility of plan \( z \) is:
    \[
    \mathbb{E}[u(z)] = \int u(x) \, dF(x).
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    If two consumption plans \( z \) and \( z' \) have the same distribution function \( F \), then they yield the same expected utility:
    \[
    \mathbb{E}[u(z)] = \mathbb{E}[u(z')].
    \]
    Thus, individuals are indifferent between them. This indicates that preferences in this framework are expressed over <em>distributions</em> of consumption, not specific realizations across states.
  </p>

  <h2>Preferences on Finite Distributions</h2>
  <p>
    To simplify the analysis, we assume that an individual's preferences are expressed only on <strong>finite probability distributions</strong> over a finite set \( Z \). That is, any consumption plan \( z \) must take values in a finite set \( Z \subset \mathbb{R} \). For instance, if \( Z = \{1, 2, 3\} \), consumption in any state is limited to these discrete units.
  </p>
  <p>
    This assumption is practical when goods are <em>not perfectly divisible</em> or supply is limited. A consumption plan can be represented by a probability mass function \( p \) on \( Z \), where:
    \[
    p(z) \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } z \in Z, \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{z \in Z} p(z) = 1.
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    The expected utility of such a plan becomes:
    \[
    \mathbb{E}[u(z)] = \sum_{z \in Z} u(z) \cdot p(z).
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    This framework is equivalent to viewing a consumption plan as a <em>lottery</em> over the elements of \( Z \), where \( p(z) \) is the probability of receiving prize \( z \). The set of all such probability measures is denoted by \( \mathcal{P} \), with elements like \( p, q, r \in \mathcal{P} \).
  </p>
  
  <h2>Axioms for Expected Utility Representation</h2>
  <p>
    A binary relation \( \succeq \) on the set of probability distributions \( \mathcal{P} \) has an <strong>expected utility representation</strong> if and only if it satisfies the following three behavioral axioms:
  </p>

  <p><strong>Axiom 1 (Preference Relation):</strong><br>
    \( \succeq \) is a preference relation on \( \mathcal{P} \), i.e., it is transitive and complete.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Axiom 2 (Independence or Substitution):</strong><br>
    For all \( p, q, r \in \mathcal{P} \) and \( \alpha \in (0,1] \),
    \[
    p \succ q \Rightarrow \alpha p + (1 - \alpha)r \succ \alpha q + (1 - \alpha)r.
    \]
    This captures the idea that preferences between lotteries depend only on their differing components. If a decision-maker prefers \( p \) over \( q \), they should also prefer a lottery mixing \( p \) with \( r \) over the same mixture with \( q \).
  </p>

  <p><strong>Axiom 3 (Archimedean Axiom):</strong><br>
    For all \( p, q, r \in \mathcal{P} \) such that \( p \succ q \succ r \), there exist \( \alpha, \beta \in (0,1) \) such that:
    \[
    \alpha p + (1 - \alpha)r \succ q \succ \beta p + (1 - \beta)r.
    \]
    This ensures that extreme preferences do not dominate the decision framework infinitely. Intuitively, no consumption plan is so good or bad that it can’t be "averaged" into or out of favor by probabilistic mixing.
  </p>

  <p>
    When \( p, q, r \) are sure outcomes (e.g., \( p(z) = 1 \), etc.), this axiom implies that mixtures of more or less preferred outcomes can be ordered around a certain middle-ground certainty, reinforcing the consistency of probabilistic preferences.
  </p>

  <h2>Properties of Preference Relations Under the Three Axioms</h2>

  <p>
    If a binary relation \( \succeq \) on the set of probability distributions \( \mathcal{P} \) satisfies the three axioms (Preference, Independence, and Archimedean), then several intuitive properties follow. Let \( P_x \) denote the degenerate distribution at \( x \in Z \), i.e.,
    \[
    P_x(x') =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if } x' = x, \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
    \]
    This represents a sure consumption plan with \( x \) units in every state.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Monotonicity of Mixing:</strong><br>
      If \( p \succ q \) and \( 0 \leq a < b \leq 1 \), then
      \[
      bp + (1 - b)q \succ ap + (1 - a)q.
      \]
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Existence of Unique Indifference Point:</strong><br>
      If \( p \succeq q \succeq r \), then there exists a unique \( \alpha^* \in [0,1] \) such that
      \[
      q \sim \alpha^* p + (1 - \alpha^*) r.
      \]
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Mixing with Intermediate Preferences:</strong><br>
      If \( p \succ q \succ r \) and \( \alpha \in [0,1] \), then
      \[
      \alpha q + (1 - \alpha) r \prec \alpha p + (1 - \alpha) r.
      \]
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Mixing with Indifference:</strong><br>
      If \( p \sim q \) and \( \alpha \in [0,1] \), then
      \[
      p \sim \alpha p + (1 - \alpha) q.
      \]
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Preservation of Indifference Under Mixing:</strong><br>
      If \( p \sim q \), then for all \( r \in \mathcal{P} \) and \( \alpha \in [0,1] \),
      \[
      \alpha p + (1 - \alpha) r \sim \alpha q + (1 - \alpha) r.
      \]
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Existence of Bounds:</strong><br>
      There exist \( x_{\min}, x_{\max} \in Z \) such that for all \( p \in \mathcal{P} \),
      \[
      P_{x_{\max}} \succeq p \succeq P_{x_{\min}}.
      \]
      That is, the best and worst sure consumption plans serve as upper and lower bounds, respectively, under the preference relation.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These properties follow naturally when preferences are well-behaved in the sense of the expected utility framework. Readers are encouraged to prove these as Exercise 1.3.
  </p>

  <h2>Proof of Expected Utility Representation</h2>

  <p>
    We now prove that a binary relation \( \succeq \) on the set of probability distributions \( \mathcal{P} \) has an expected utility representation if and only if it satisfies the three axioms discussed earlier.
  </p>

  <h3>Case 1: Indifference Between All Distributions</h3>
  <p>
    If \( p \sim q \) for all \( p, q \in \mathcal{P} \), then a constant utility function \( u(z) = k \) for all \( z \in Z \) represents the preference relation. This is trivial, as all lotteries are treated equally.
  </p>

  <h3>Case 2: Nontrivial Preferences</h3>
  <p>
    Suppose \( \succeq \) is not trivial. Let \( x^* \in Z \) be the best outcome and \( x_* \in Z \) the worst, such that for all \( p \in \mathcal{P} \), \( P_{x^*} \succeq p \succeq P_{x_*} \). For any \( p \in \mathcal{P} \), define a number \( H(p) \in (0,1) \) such that:
    \[
    p \sim H(p) P_{x^*} + (1 - H(p)) P_{x_*}.
    \]
    This \( H(p) \) is uniquely defined by Property 2 from the previous section (existence and uniqueness of indifference point). Hence, the function \( H: \mathcal{P} \rightarrow [0,1] \) is well-defined and represents the preference relation: \( H(p) \geq H(q) \iff p \succeq q \).
  </p>

  <p>
    However, we want to express \( H(p) \) as an expected value over a function \( u \) defined on \( Z \), i.e., a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. To do this, we construct \( u \) directly. From repeated use of the linearity property (Property 5), we know:
    \[
    H(ap + (1 - a)q) = a H(p) + (1 - a) H(q), \quad \forall a \in [0,1].
    \]
    Thus, \( H \) is a linear function over \( \mathcal{P} \).
  </p>

  <p>
    Now define \( u: Z \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) by
    \[
    u(z) = H(P_z), \quad \text{for all } z \in Z.
    \]
    This assigns utility to sure outcomes as the value of \( H \) on the degenerate lottery \( P_z \).
  </p>

  <p>
    Let \( p \in \mathcal{P} \) be an arbitrary probability distribution. Note that \( p \sim \sum_{z \in Z} p(z) P_z \), i.e., the lottery \( p \) is equivalent to a compound lottery over sure outcomes. Using linearity of \( H \), we get:
    \[
    H(p) = H\left(\sum_{z \in Z} p(z) P_z\right) = \sum_{z \in Z} p(z) H(P_z) = \sum_{z \in Z} p(z) u(z).
    \]
    Thus, the utility function \( u \) satisfies:
    \[
    p \succeq q \iff \sum_{z \in Z} u(z) p(z) \geq \sum_{z \in Z} u(z) q(z),
    \]
    proving that \( u \) is a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, this function \( u \) is unique up to a strictly positive linear transformation. That is, if \( \tilde{u} \) also represents the same preferences, then there exist constants \( c > 0 \) and \( d \in \mathbb{R} \) such that:
    \[
    \tilde{u}(z) = c u(z) + d, \quad \text{for all } z \in Z.
    \]
  </p>

  <p>
    Conversely, if a preference relation can be represented as:
    \[
    p \succeq q \iff \sum_{z \in Z} u(z) p(z) \geq \sum_{z \in Z} u(z) q(z),
    \]
    then it satisfies the three axioms (Preference, Independence, and Archimedean), completing the proof.
  </p>

  <h2>Extension of the Expected Utility Representation</h2>
  <p>We proved the expected utility representation theorem under the assumption that the outcome set \( Z \) is finite. However, when \( Z \) is infinite—for example, when it includes all positive real numbers—this representation no longer holds without additional assumptions.</p>

  <p>To extend the theorem to infinite \( Z \), we require a <strong>fourth axiom</strong>, called the <em>Sure Thing Principle</em>. It states: if a consumption plan \( p \) is concentrated on a subset \( B \subset Z \) where every element in \( B \) is at least as good as some plan \( q \), then \( p \) must be at least as good as \( q \).</p>

  <p>With this fourth axiom and some technical conditions, we can establish an expected utility representation for general (possibly infinite) outcome spaces \( Z \).</p>

  <h4>Multiple Time Periods</h4>
  <p>This framework also extends to consumption occurring over multiple time periods \( t = 0, 1, \dots, T \). Let \( Z \) be the set of consumption tuples \( z = (z_0, \dots, z_T) \), where each \( z_t \) denotes consumption at time \( t \).</p>

  <p>A probability distribution \( p \) over \( Z \) satisfies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>\( p(z) \in [0, 1] \) for all \( z \in Z \), and</li>
    <li>\( \sum_{z \in Z} p(z) = 1 \).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Preferences over these distributions again lead to a utility representation: there exists a von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function \( u \) such that for all \( p, q \in \mathcal{P} \):</p>

  <p>
    \[
    p \succeq q \iff \sum_{z \in Z} u(z_0, \dots, z_T) \cdot p(z) \geq \sum_{z \in Z} u(z_0, \dots, z_T) \cdot q(z)
    \]
  </p>

  <h4>Time-Additive Utility</h4>
  <p>For simplicity in financial applications, utility is often assumed to be <em>time-additive</em>, meaning there exist functions \( u_t(\cdot) \) for each time \( t \) such that:</p>

  <p>
    \[
    u(z_0, \dots, z_T) = \sum_{t=0}^T u_t(z_t)
    \]
  </p>

  <p>This assumption simplifies analysis but is strong. It implies that consumption at one time doesn't affect preferences for consumption at another time—for example, having a large lunch doesn't affect desire for a big dinner. Hence, conclusions drawn under this assumption should be interpreted carefully.</p>

  <h2>Boundedness of von Neumann–Morgenstern Utility Functions</h2>
  <p>One implication of the expected utility theory is that a von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function must be bounded when probability distributions involve unbounded consumption levels. This follows from the <em>Archimedean Axiom</em>.</p>

  <p>To see this, suppose the utility function \( u \) is unbounded from above and that the set \( Z \) contains all positive consumption levels. Then there exists a sequence \( \{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \) such that \( z_n \to \infty \) and \( u(z_n) \geq 2^n \). Now consider a probability distribution \( p \) such that \( p(z_n) = 2^{-n} \) for each \( n \). This plan has unbounded consumption levels.</p>

  <p>The expected utility is then</p>
  <p>
    \[
    \sum_{n=1}^\infty u(z_n) \cdot p(z_n) \geq \sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^n \cdot 2^{-n} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1 = \infty
    \]
  </p>

  <p>Suppose there exist \( q, r \in \mathcal{P} \) such that \( p \succsim q \succsim r \). Then \( u(q) \) and \( u(r) \) must be finite. This violates the Archimedean Axiom, which requires that there exists a probability mix between \( p \) and \( r \) that is indifferent to \( q \). Hence, \( u \) must be bounded.</p>

  <h4>Handling Unbounded Utility in Applications</h4>
  <p>This boundedness is unsettling because many commonly used utility functions are unbounded. Examples include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Logarithmic utility: \( u(z) = \log z \)</li>
    <li>Power utility: \( u(z) = z^{1 - \beta} \)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Both are unbounded on \( (0, \infty) \) depending on \( \beta \). To resolve this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Restrict attention to consumption plans over <em>finite sets</em> of consumption levels—common in finite state models.</li>
    <li>Use <em>concave</em> utility functions with consumption plans having <em>finite expectations</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If \( u \) is concave and differentiable at some point \( b > 0 \), then by concavity:</p>
  <p>
    \[
    u(z) \leq u(b) + u'(b)(z - b), \quad \forall z
    \]
  </p>

  <p>Taking expectation on both sides, if \( z \) is a random variable with finite expectation:</p>
  <p>
    \[
    \mathbb{E}[u(z)] \leq u(b) + u'(b)(\mathbb{E}[z] - b) < \infty
    \]
  </p>

  <p>This means expected utility remains finite even if \( u \) is unbounded, provided \( u \) is concave and the random consumption has finite expectation.</p>

  <p>This result extends naturally to time-additive utility functions:</p>
  <p>
    \[
    u(z_0, \dots, z_T) = \sum_{t=0}^{T} u_t(z_t)
    \]
  </p>
  <p>So long as each \( u_t \) is concave and consumption at each time has finite expectation, expected utility remains finite.</p>

  <h2>The Allais Paradox and the Substitution Axiom</h2>

  <p>The <strong>Substitution Axiom</strong> (also known as the <em>Independence Axiom</em>) is a key part of the expected utility theory, but empirical experiments show that it is frequently violated. A famous example of this is the <strong>Allais Paradox</strong>, which demonstrates how actual human preferences can contradict the axiom.</p>

  <p>Consider the following two pairs of lotteries:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pair 1:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>\( P_1 \): \$1 million for sure.</li>
        <li>\( P_2 \): \$5 million with probability 0.1, \$1 million with probability 0.89, \$0 with probability 0.01.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Pair 2:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>\( P_3 \): \$0 with probability 0.11, \$5 million with probability 0.89.</li>
        <li>\( P_4 \): \$0 with probability 0.11, \$1 million with probability 0.89.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Most people prefer \( P_1 \) over \( P_2 \), valuing the certainty of receiving \$1 million. However, when faced with \( P_3 \) and \( P_4 \), they prefer \( P_3 \), chasing the higher reward despite the same small risk of ending up with nothing.</p>

  <h4>Violation of the Substitution Axiom</h4>

  <p>This behavior contradicts the Substitution Axiom, which states that if you prefer one lottery over another, you should still prefer it when both are mixed with a third lottery in the same proportions. Let's write this formally:</p>

  <p>Assume:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>\( P_1 = \delta_1 \): certain \$1 million.</li>
    <li>\( P_2 = 0.01 \cdot \$0 + 0.89 \cdot \$1m + 0.1 \cdot \$5m \)</li>
    <li>\( P_3 = 0.11 \cdot \$0 + 0.89 \cdot \$5m \)</li>
    <li>\( P_4 = 0.11 \cdot \$0 + 0.89 \cdot \$1m \)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To illustrate the contradiction, we express \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) using common denominators:</p>

  <p>
    \[
    P_1 = \frac{11}{11}(\$1m)
    \]
    \[
    P_2 = \frac{1}{11}(\$0) + \frac{1}{11}(\$5m) + \frac{9}{11}(\$1m)
    \]
  </p>

  <p>If people prefer \( P_1 \succ P_2 \), then by transitivity:</p>

  <p>
    \[
    \frac{11}{11}(\$1m) \succ \frac{1}{11}(\$0) + \frac{1}{11}(\$5m) + \frac{9}{11}(\$1m)
    \]
  </p>

  <p>Subtracting the common \( \frac{9}{11}(\$1m) \) from both sides (as allowed by the <strong>Substitution Axiom</strong>):</p>

  <p>
    \[
    \frac{2}{11}(\$1m) \succ \frac{1}{11}(\$0) + \frac{1}{11}(\$5m)
    \]
  </p>

  <p>This implies:</p>

  <p>
    \[
    P_1 \succ \frac{1}{2}(\$0) + \frac{1}{2}(\$5m)
    \]
  </p>

  <p>Now consider the second pair of lotteries:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>\( P_3 = 0.11(\$0) + 0.89(\$5m) \)</li>
    <li>\( P_4 = 0.11(\$0) + 0.89(\$1m) \)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If someone chooses \( P_3 \succ P_4 \), then they are implicitly saying:</p>

  <p>
    \[
    0.11(\$0) + 0.89(\$5m) \succ 0.11(\$0) + 0.89(\$1m)
    \]
  </p>

  <p>By canceling the common \( 0.11(\$0) \), this is equivalent to:</p>

  <p>
    \[
    \frac{1}{11}(\$5m) \succ \frac{1}{11}(\$1m)
    \]
  </p>

  <p>But this contradicts the previous comparison where \( \frac{1}{11}(\$5m) + \frac{1}{11}(\$0) \prec \frac{2}{11}(\$1m) \). Thus, choosing \( P_1 \succ P_2 \) and \( P_3 \succ P_4 \) violates the Substitution Axiom.</p>

  <h2>Risk Aversion and Concavity of Utility</h2>

  <p>An individual is <strong>risk averse</strong> if they are unwilling or indifferent to accepting an <em>actuarially fair gamble</em>. They are <strong>strictly risk averse</strong> if they <em>never</em> accept any such gamble.</p>

  <p>Consider a gamble where an individual with initial wealth \( W_0 \) receives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A positive return \( h_1 \) with probability \( p \),</li>
    <li>A negative return \( h_2 \) with probability \( 1 - p \).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The gamble is <strong>actuarially fair</strong> if the expected monetary payoff is zero:</p>

  <p>
    \[
    p h_1 + (1 - p) h_2 = 0
    \]
  </p>

  <p>Let \( u(\cdot) \) be the utility function. Then risk aversion implies:</p>

  <p>
    \[
    u(W_0) \geq p \cdot u(W_0 + h_1) + (1 - p) \cdot u(W_0 + h_2)
    \]
  </p>

  <p>Using the fair gamble condition, this can be rewritten as:</p>

  <p>
    \[
    u\left(p(W_0 + h_1) + (1 - p)(W_0 + h_2)\right) \geq p \cdot u(W_0 + h_1) + (1 - p) \cdot u(W_0 + h_2)
    \]
  </p>

  <p>This inequality shows that the utility of the expected payoff is greater than or equal to the expected utility of the gamble. This is precisely the definition of a <strong>concave function</strong>. Thus:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Risk aversion ⇔ \( u(\cdot) \) is concave.</li>
    <li>Strict risk aversion ⇔ \( u(\cdot) \) is strictly concave.</li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="hl117.png" alt="Concave Utility Function Illustration" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border-radius: 12px;">
    <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555; margin-top: 8px;"><em>Figure: A strictly concave utility function — expected utility lies below utility of expected payoff</em></p>
  </div>

  <p><strong>The above figure </strong> (conceptually) shows:</p>

  <p>
    \[
    u(W_0) > p \cdot u(W_0 + h_1) + (1 - p) \cdot u(W_0 + h_2)
    \]
  </p>

  <p>The expected utility lies below the chord joining \( u(W_0 + h_1) \) and \( u(W_0 + h_2) \) — a hallmark of strict concavity. This visual demonstrates that the individual prefers the sure amount over the fair gamble, thus confirming strict risk aversion.</p>

 
  <h2>1.18 Portfolio Choice of a Risk-Averse Individual</h2>

  <p>
    Consider a risk-averse individual who has strictly increasing and concave utility over final wealth. They must allocate an initial wealth \( W_0 \) between a risk-free asset and a set of risky assets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let \( r_f \) denote the return on the risk-free asset, and let \( r_j \) be the (random) return on the \( j \)-th risky asset. Let \( \alpha_j \) denote the dollar amount invested in risky asset \( j \). The remaining wealth \( W_0 - \sum_j \alpha_j \) is invested in the risk-free asset.
  </p>

  <p>
    The total wealth at the end of the period, \( W \), is then given by:
  </p>

  \[
  W = (W_0 - \sum_j \alpha_j)(1 + r_f) + \sum_j \alpha_j (1 + r_j)
  \]

  <p>
    Expanding and simplifying:
  </p>

  \[
  W = W_0(1 + r_f) + \sum_j \alpha_j (r_j - r_f)
  \]

  <p>
    The individual's objective is to choose the allocation \( \{\alpha_j\} \) to maximize expected utility of wealth:
  </p>

  \[
  \max_{\{\alpha_j\}} \mathbb{E}\left[u\left(W_0(1 + r_f) + \sum_j \alpha_j (r_j - r_f)\right)\right]
  \]

  <p>
    Since \( u \) is concave and differentiable, we can derive first-order conditions for optimality by differentiating the objective with respect to each \( \alpha_j \) and setting the derivative equal to zero:
  </p>

  \[
  \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha_j} \mathbb{E}[u(W)] = \mathbb{E}\left[u'(W)(r_j - r_f)\right] = 0 \quad \forall j
  \]

  <p>
    These first-order conditions are necessary and sufficient due to concavity of \( u \). They imply that the marginal utility-weighted return in excess of the risk-free rate must be zero in expectation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, because \( u \) is strictly increasing, \( u'(W) > 0 \), so the expected excess returns \( r_j - r_f \) must take both positive and negative values. That is, the distribution of risky returns must be non-degenerate.
  </p>

  <p>
    This framework is fundamental in modern portfolio theory, leading directly to concepts like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) under additional assumptions.
  </p>
