  <h2>Expected Utility and Individual Decisions</h2>
  <p>
    This chapter introduces the central theme of the book: how individuals make consumption and investment decisions under uncertainty, and how these decisions influence the valuation of financial assets.
  </p>
  <p>
    A widely accepted framework for modeling asset choice under uncertainty is the <strong>expected utility hypothesis</strong>. Under this hypothesis, each individual:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Forms subjective probabilities of future asset payoffs</li>
    <li>Assigns a utility value to each possible consumption outcome</li>
    <li>Chooses a consumption-investment policy to maximize expected utility</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Mathematically, preferences are represented by a utility function \( u(\cdot) \), and a random consumption outcome \( x \) is preferred to another outcome \( y \) if and only if:
  </p>
  <p>
    \[
      \mathbb{E}[u(x)] \geq \mathbb{E}[u(y)]
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    where the expectation \( \mathbb{E} \) is taken with respect to the individual's subjective probability distribution over outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2>Consumption Plans and Expected Utility Representation</h2>
  <p>
    Consider a two-period model: time 0 (decision point) and time 1 (consumption). Uncertainty is captured through a finite set of states of nature, denoted by \( \Omega \), with \( \omega \in \Omega \) representing an individual state.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <strong>consumption plan</strong> \( z \) specifies the number of units of a single good available in each state at time 1. This plan can be viewed as a vector or a random variable, with \( z(\omega) \) representing consumption in state \( \omega \).
  </p>
  <p>
    Preferences over such plans are represented by a <em>preference relation</em> that allows the comparison of different consumption vectors. If preferences can be captured by a utility function \( H \), then:
  </p>
  <p>
    \[
      z \succeq z' \iff H(z) \geq H(z')
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    To simplify analysis in high-dimensional state spaces, we use an <strong>expected utility representation</strong>:
  </p>
  <p>
    \[
      z \succeq z' \iff \mathbb{E}[u(z)] \geq \mathbb{E}[u(z')]
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    where \( u \) is defined on deterministic (sure) outcomes and extended to random plans via integration under a probability measure \( P \). For certain plans \( z = x \), \( u(z) = u(x) \).
  </p>
  <p>
    This framework leads to the <strong>von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function</strong>, developed under objective probability assumptions, and extended by Savage under subjective beliefs. In this book, the distinction is not emphasized—both are treated as defining \( u \) over certain outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2>Preference Relations: Definitions and Properties</h2>
  <p>
    Let \( X \) denote the set of all possible consumption plans. A <strong>binary relation</strong> on \( X \) is a collection of ordered pairs \( (z, y) \) where plan \( z \) is compared to plan \( y \). If \( z \) is preferred to \( y \), we write \( z \succeq y \); otherwise, we write \( z \not\succeq y \).
  </p>
  <p>
    A binary relation is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transitive</strong> if \( z \succeq y \) and \( y \succeq v \) implies \( z \succeq v \).</li>
    <li><strong>Complete</strong> if for any \( z, y \in X \), either \( z \succeq y \), \( y \succeq z \), or both.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A <strong>preference relation</strong> is a binary relation that is both transitive and complete.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on a preference relation \( \succeq \), we can define:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Indifference</strong>: \( z \sim y \) if \( z \succeq y \) and \( y \succeq z \)</li>
    <li><strong>Strict preference</strong>: \( z \succ y \) if \( z \succeq y \) but not \( y \succeq z \)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These derived relations help classify how individuals compare consumption plans under uncertainty.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Utility Representation for Finite Preferences</h2>
  <p>
    When the set \( X \) of consumption plans is finite, any preference relation \( \succeq \) can be represented by a utility function \( U \), such that
    \[
    z_n \succeq z_m \quad \text{if and only if} \quad U(z_n) \geq U(z_m).
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    The construction of such a utility function is illustrated through an example. Let \( z_1, z_2, z_3 \in X \). Start by assigning a base value to one plan, say:
    \[
    H(z_3) = b.
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    Then compare \( z_2 \) and \( z_1 \) with \( z_3 \), and define \( H(z_2) \) and \( H(z_1) \) accordingly:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If \( z_2 \succ z_3 \), assign \( H(z_2) = b + 1 \)</li>
    <li>If \( z_2 \sim z_3 \), assign \( H(z_2) = b \)</li>
    <li>If \( z_2 \prec z_3 \), assign \( H(z_2) = b - 1 \)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Similarly, assign values to \( H(z_1) \) based on its comparison with the others. This procedure ensures that:
    \[
    H(z_n) \geq H(z_m) \quad \text{if and only if} \quad z_n \succeq z_m.
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    The example shows how a numerical index can capture preference rankings. This construction can be extended to any countable set \( X \), ensuring utility representation for complete and transitive preferences.
  </p>

  <h2>Expected Utility Representation</h2>
  <p>
    For an uncountably infinite set of consumption plans, preference relations are more nuanced. Some, such as the <em>lexicographic preference relation</em>, cannot be represented by any utility function.
  </p>
  <p>
    To represent preferences under uncertainty, we use the <strong>expected utility framework</strong>. Let \( \Omega \) denote the state space with probability \( P \), which can be either objective or subjective. A <em>consumption plan</em> \( z \) is modeled as a random variable defined on \( \Omega \).
  </p>
  <p>
    The distribution function \( F \) of a consumption plan \( z \) is:
    \[
    F(x) = P(\omega \in \Omega : z(\omega) \leq x).
    \]
    Given a utility function \( u \), the expected utility of plan \( z \) is:
    \[
    \mathbb{E}[u(z)] = \int u(x) \, dF(x).
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    If two consumption plans \( z \) and \( z' \) have the same distribution function \( F \), then they yield the same expected utility:
    \[
    \mathbb{E}[u(z)] = \mathbb{E}[u(z')].
    \]
    Thus, individuals are indifferent between them. This indicates that preferences in this framework are expressed over <em>distributions</em> of consumption, not specific realizations across states.
  </p>

  <h2>Preferences on Finite Distributions</h2>
  <p>
    To simplify the analysis, we assume that an individual's preferences are expressed only on <strong>finite probability distributions</strong> over a finite set \( Z \). That is, any consumption plan \( z \) must take values in a finite set \( Z \subset \mathbb{R} \). For instance, if \( Z = \{1, 2, 3\} \), consumption in any state is limited to these discrete units.
  </p>
  <p>
    This assumption is practical when goods are <em>not perfectly divisible</em> or supply is limited. A consumption plan can be represented by a probability mass function \( p \) on \( Z \), where:
    \[
    p(z) \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } z \in Z, \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{z \in Z} p(z) = 1.
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    The expected utility of such a plan becomes:
    \[
    \mathbb{E}[u(z)] = \sum_{z \in Z} u(z) \cdot p(z).
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    This framework is equivalent to viewing a consumption plan as a <em>lottery</em> over the elements of \( Z \), where \( p(z) \) is the probability of receiving prize \( z \). The set of all such probability measures is denoted by \( \mathcal{P} \), with elements like \( p, q, r \in \mathcal{P} \).
  </p>
  
  <h2>Axioms for Expected Utility Representation</h2>
  <p>
    A binary relation \( \succeq \) on the set of probability distributions \( \mathcal{P} \) has an <strong>expected utility representation</strong> if and only if it satisfies the following three behavioral axioms:
  </p>

  <p><strong>Axiom 1 (Preference Relation):</strong><br>
    \( \succeq \) is a preference relation on \( \mathcal{P} \), i.e., it is transitive and complete.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Axiom 2 (Independence or Substitution):</strong><br>
    For all \( p, q, r \in \mathcal{P} \) and \( \alpha \in (0,1] \),
    \[
    p \succ q \Rightarrow \alpha p + (1 - \alpha)r \succ \alpha q + (1 - \alpha)r.
    \]
    This captures the idea that preferences between lotteries depend only on their differing components. If a decision-maker prefers \( p \) over \( q \), they should also prefer a lottery mixing \( p \) with \( r \) over the same mixture with \( q \).
  </p>

  <p><strong>Axiom 3 (Archimedean Axiom):</strong><br>
    For all \( p, q, r \in \mathcal{P} \) such that \( p \succ q \succ r \), there exist \( \alpha, \beta \in (0,1) \) such that:
    \[
    \alpha p + (1 - \alpha)r \succ q \succ \beta p + (1 - \beta)r.
    \]
    This ensures that extreme preferences do not dominate the decision framework infinitely. Intuitively, no consumption plan is so good or bad that it can’t be "averaged" into or out of favor by probabilistic mixing.
  </p>

  <p>
    When \( p, q, r \) are sure outcomes (e.g., \( p(z) = 1 \), etc.), this axiom implies that mixtures of more or less preferred outcomes can be ordered around a certain middle-ground certainty, reinforcing the consistency of probabilistic preferences.
  </p>

  <h2>Properties of Preference Relations Under the Three Axioms</h2>

  <p>
    If a binary relation \( \succeq \) on the set of probability distributions \( \mathcal{P} \) satisfies the three axioms (Preference, Independence, and Archimedean), then several intuitive properties follow. Let \( P_x \) denote the degenerate distribution at \( x \in Z \), i.e.,
    \[
    P_x(x') =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if } x' = x, \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
    \]
    This represents a sure consumption plan with \( x \) units in every state.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Monotonicity of Mixing:</strong><br>
      If \( p \succ q \) and \( 0 \leq a < b \leq 1 \), then
      \[
      bp + (1 - b)q \succ ap + (1 - a)q.
      \]
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Existence of Unique Indifference Point:</strong><br>
      If \( p \succeq q \succeq r \), then there exists a unique \( \alpha^* \in [0,1] \) such that
      \[
      q \sim \alpha^* p + (1 - \alpha^*) r.
      \]
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Mixing with Intermediate Preferences:</strong><br>
      If \( p \succ q \succ r \) and \( \alpha \in [0,1] \), then
      \[
      \alpha q + (1 - \alpha) r \prec \alpha p + (1 - \alpha) r.
      \]
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Mixing with Indifference:</strong><br>
      If \( p \sim q \) and \( \alpha \in [0,1] \), then
      \[
      p \sim \alpha p + (1 - \alpha) q.
      \]
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Preservation of Indifference Under Mixing:</strong><br>
      If \( p \sim q \), then for all \( r \in \mathcal{P} \) and \( \alpha \in [0,1] \),
      \[
      \alpha p + (1 - \alpha) r \sim \alpha q + (1 - \alpha) r.
      \]
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Existence of Bounds:</strong><br>
      There exist \( x_{\min}, x_{\max} \in Z \) such that for all \( p \in \mathcal{P} \),
      \[
      P_{x_{\max}} \succeq p \succeq P_{x_{\min}}.
      \]
      That is, the best and worst sure consumption plans serve as upper and lower bounds, respectively, under the preference relation.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These properties follow naturally when preferences are well-behaved in the sense of the expected utility framework. Readers are encouraged to prove these as Exercise 1.3.
