  <h2>First Degree Stochastic Dominance</h2>

  <p>
    Risky asset A is said to dominate risky asset B in the sense of <strong>First Degree Stochastic Dominance (FSD)</strong>, denoted as \( A \succeq_{FSD} B \), if every individual with a utility function that is <em>increasing and continuous in wealth</em> either prefers A over B or is indifferent between them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The underlying intuition is straightforward: if, for every level of return \( z \in [0,1] \), the probability that A gives a return less than \( z \) is <em>less than or equal to</em> that of B, then A is considered better. In other words:
  </p>

  <p>
    \[
    F_A(z) \leq F_B(z) \quad \text{for all } z \in [0,1],
    \]
    where \( F_A(\cdot) \) and \( F_B(\cdot) \) are the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of returns on assets A and B, respectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since the CDF gives the probability that a return is <em>less than or equal to</em> a certain value, the inequality \( F_A(z) \leq F_B(z) \) means that A tends to deliver higher returns more often than B. Thus, any nonsatiable (strictly increasing utility) individual would prefer A.
  </p>

  <h4>Properties and Assumptions</h4>
  <p>
    We assume:
    <ul>
      <li>The returns of A and B lie in the interval \([0,1]\).</li>
      <li>The CDFs \( F_A(\cdot) \) and \( F_B(\cdot) \) are right-continuous and satisfy \( F_A(1) = F_B(1) = 1 \).</li>
      <li>They may have different masses at zero: \( F_A(0) \neq F_B(0) \).</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h4>Interpretation</h4>
  <p>
    Condition \( F_A(z) \leq F_B(z) \) for all \( z \) implies that:
    <ul>
      <li>The probability that A returns less than \( z \) is lower than B’s.</li>
      <li>Equivalently, the probability that A returns more than \( z \) is higher than B’s.</li>
    </ul>
    However, this <strong>does not imply</strong> that A always yields a higher realized return than B. There can be scenarios where B performs better than A in a particular outcome.
  </p>

  <h4>Illustrative Example</h4>
  <p>
    Suppose assets A and B can each take on the values 0, \( \frac{1}{2} \), and 1. Let the cumulative probabilities (from Figure 1) be such that for each level \( z \in \{0, \frac{1}{2}, 1\} \), the condition \( F_A(z) \leq F_B(z) \) is satisfied.
  </p>
  <figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="hl211.png" alt="FSD" width="500">
    <figcaption><em>Figure 1:</em> FIRST DEGREE STOCHASTIC DOMINANCE</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    For example, even though A satisfies FSD over B, it is possible that in one realization A yields 0 while B yields 1. If A and B are independent, the probability of this particular event might be 0.05. So ex post, B may outperform A, but ex ante, A is preferred under FSD.
  </p>

  <p>
    The concept of FSD thus captures a strong form of dominance: A is better for <em>every decision maker</em> whose preferences are increasing in wealth. This condition is both <strong>necessary and sufficient</strong> for FSD.
  </p>


  <h2>Characterization of First-Order Stochastic Dominance (FSD)</h2>

  <p>
    A more intuitive characterization of First-Order Stochastic Dominance (FSD) is based on the idea of comparing one asset’s returns to another’s by adding a positive “bonus” return. Suppose asset A’s return \( r_A \) can be written as the sum of asset B’s return \( r_B \) and a positive random variable \( \delta \), i.e., 
    \[
    r_A = r_B + \delta, \quad \text{where } \delta > 0 \text{ with probability 1}.
    \]
    Then for any increasing utility function \( u(\cdot) \), we have:
    \[
    \mathbb{E}[u(1 + r_A)] = \mathbb{E}[u(1 + r_B + \delta)] \geq \mathbb{E}[u(1 + r_B)].
    \]
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Why does this inequality hold?</strong> Because the utility function \( u \) is increasing, adding a positive value \( \delta \) to \( r_B \) will always increase the utility — or at least not decrease it. This is a direct consequence of monotonicity: more is better.
  </p>

  <h4>Real-Life Analogy</h4>
  <p>
    Imagine two job offers: Job B pays a variable salary, say between ₹30k to ₹50k per month depending on performance. Job A is exactly the same — but always pays an additional ₹5k monthly bonus, no matter what. Every rational person who prefers more income (an increasing utility) would choose Job A. That's the idea here: asset A dominates B by always offering something extra.
  </p>

  <h4>The Converse Statement</h4>
  <p>
    Interestingly, the converse is also true (though the proof is technical and omitted): if asset A first-order stochastically dominates asset B — i.e., 
    \[
    A \succ_{\text{FSD}} B,
    \]
    then there exists a positive random variable \( \delta \) such that:
    \[
    r_A = r_B + \delta.
    \]
    In other words, the entire distribution of A's returns lies to the right of B's — A is like B, but always better by some margin.
  </p>

  <h4>Summary of Equivalent Conditions</h4>
  <p>
    By combining this result with the earlier ones in Section 2.3, we now have three equivalent ways to say that asset A first-order stochastically dominates asset B:
    <br>
    1. \( A \succ_{\text{FSD}} B \) (the formal dominance).
    <br>
    2. \( F_A(z) \leq F_B(z) \) for all \( z \in [0,1] \) (cumulative probability of A is always less than or equal to that of B).
    <br>
    3. \( r_A = r_B + \delta \), where \( \delta > 0 \) (A is just B with something extra).
  </p>

  <h4>Important Insight</h4>
  <p>
    From (3), we can conclude that if \( A \succ_{\text{FSD}} B \), then A has at least as high an <em>expected</em> rate of return as B. However, the reverse isn’t true: just having a higher expected return doesn't imply FSD.
  </p>

  <h4>Real-Life Example</h4>
  <p>
    Think of investing in two startups. Startup B gives random returns between 5% and 15%. Startup A gives returns in the range of 10% to 20%. Clearly, A always does better than B — not just on average, but in every possible outcome. A dominates B in the FSD sense. But if A just has a higher average return — say 12% vs B’s 10% — but sometimes performs worse, then A may not FSD B.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Second-Degree Stochastic Dominance (SSD)</h2>
  <p>Suppose an individual is only known to be risk-averse. Under what conditions can we unambiguously say they prefer risky asset A over B?</p>

  <p>We say that \(A \, \text{SSD} \, B\) (Second-Degree Stochastic Dominance) if all risk-averse individuals with utility functions \(u\) (with \(u'\) continuous except on a countable subset of \([1,2]\)) prefer A to B.</p>

  <p>This is true if and only if the following hold:</p>
  \[
  \int_0^1 [F_A(z) - F_B(z)]\,dz = 0,
  \]
  \[
  S(y) := \int_0^y [F_A(z) - F_B(z)]\,dz \leq 0 \quad \forall y \in [0,1].
  \]

  <p>Here, \(S(y)\) represents the cumulative difference between the CDFs of A and B. For example, in Figure 2.5.1, \(S(y)\) equals the algebraic sum of the shaded areas between \(F_A\) and \(F_B\).</p>

  <h4>Proof of Sufficiency (Sketch)</h4>
  <p>From earlier (2.3.1), we have:</p>
  \[
  \int u(1 + z) \, d[F_A(z) - F_B(z)].
  \]

  <p>Using integration by parts:</p>
  \[
  = -\int [F_A(z) - F_B(z)] \, du(1 + z) = \int S(z) \, du'(1 + z).
  \]

  <p>Since \(u''(z) \leq 0\) for risk-averse individuals, \(u'\) is decreasing. Combined with \(S(z) \leq 0\), we get:</p>
  \[
  \int S(z) \, du'(1 + z) \geq 0,
  \]

  <p>thus proving that all such individuals prefer A over B. This confirms the sufficiency of the SSD condition.</p>

  <h4>✔ Sufficiency of FSD Characterization</h4>
  
  <p>We begin by proving the sufficiency part of the equivalence characterization of first-order stochastic dominance. From equation (2.3.1), recall:</p>
  
  \[
  \int u(1 + z) \, d[F_A(z) - F_B(z)]
  \]
  
  <p>Applying <strong>integration by parts</strong>, we get:</p>
  
  \[
  \int u(1 + z) \, d[F_A(z) - F_B(z)] = - \int [F_A(z) - F_B(z)] \, du(1 + z)
  \]
  
  <p>Define:</p>
  
  \[
  S(z) = \int_0^z [F_A(t) - F_B(t)] \, dt
  \]
  
  <p>Then, by integration by parts again:</p>
  
  \[
  - \int [F_A(z) - F_B(z)] \, du(1 + z) = u'(1 + z) S(z) \bigg|_0^1 - \int_0^1 S(z) \, du'(1 + z)
  \]
  
  <p>So the integral becomes:</p>
  
  \[
  \int u(1 + z) \, d[F_A(z) - F_B(z)] = \int_0^1 S(z) \, du'(1 + z)
  \]
  
  <p>Next, observe from earlier sections:</p>
  
  \[
  S(0) = \int_0^0 [F_A(z) - F_B(z)] \, dz = 0
  \]
  
  <p>Also, using the expectation identity from (2.5.1):</p>
  
  \[
  S(1) = \int_0^1 [F_A(z) - F_B(z)] \, dz = \mathbb{E}[i_B] - \mathbb{E}[i_A] = 0
  \]
  
  <p>Thus, we arrive at the final form of the integral expression (equation 2.6.3):</p>
  
  \[
  \int_0^1 u(1 + z) \, d[F_A(z) - F_B(z)] = \int_0^1 S(z) \, du'(1 + z)
  \]
  
  <p>Now, from condition (2.5.2), we know \( S(z) \geq 0 \) for all \( z \in [0, 1] \). Also, since \( u \) is concave (and hence \( u' \) is decreasing), \( du'(1 + z) \leq 0 \). Therefore, we conclude:</p>
  
  \[
  \int_0^1 S(z) \, du'(1 + z) \leq 0
  \]
  
  <p>Hence,</p>
  
  \[
  \int u(1 + z) \, d[F_A(z) - F_B(z)] \leq 0
  \]
  
  <p>This inequality shows that all individuals with increasing utility functions prefer asset A to asset B when \( F_A \) first-order stochastically dominates \( F_B \), completing the proof of sufficiency.</p>
